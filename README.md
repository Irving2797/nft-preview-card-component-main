## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

So I was so confused because the div I used for the overlay was not inside of the container, therefore the hover was not working. I just needed to put it inside the container, rookie mistake but glad I made it.

```html
<div class="container">
    <img id="main_img" src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Equilibrium">
        <div class="viewoverlay"><img src="images/icon-view.svg"></div>
</div>
```

I always forget that I can group classes and elements this way
```css
.container:hover .viewoverlay,
.container:hover .viewoverlay img {
    display: unset;
}
```
